<!-- 
Components are... well, you know what they are.
One difference is they are available a different way. Rather than defining and importing the components,
cont. you will directly reference the name of THIS file. AKA: <Book-Card>
Build how you usually do. In this instance, this will be the repeated card for each new book added to the website.
Data consumed:
 ~ Book name
 ~ Book desc
 ~ Book Picture
Constaints:
 ~ Expandable on click, not hover. Heard somewhere that its better User experience to have the option to click, rather than hover.
