<!-- 
This index is necessary for some reason. I don't really understand it. Maybe its the landing point for other pages?
cont. and, like, the directory when searching for <NuxtPage /> is this? Thats my interpretation
Can safely do nothing with this, it seems. 


OKAY, so, index.vue is a very specific name. It means we are in the root of the CURRENT DIRECTORY. AKA, this is the 
cont. root of pages, so the path to reach this would literally be /. Whereas, if we were in the pathway /book/index.vue
cont. , the way to render it would be /book. NOT /book/index. Index literally means the root.
