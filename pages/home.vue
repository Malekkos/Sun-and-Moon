<!-- 
First page of many!
This will be home, it will have some jumping off points to other sections of the website, and will
cont. function as a preview of some novels/features. This would be a good time to take from WebNovel;
cont. subpar leadership aside, it has a pretty good homepage IMO.

<!-- 
Another useful feature, useSeoMeta({}). We can use this to define page meanings. Say we use description: "",
cont. this would show in page results when searching for things. We can also use ogImage:, ogDescription:(think
cont. like its summarized description), and more.
We can do the above inline with <Head> elements or <Title> elements, but i prefer putting them in script.
