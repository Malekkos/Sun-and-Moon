<!-- 
 
This should be the template page for the dynamic route system.
It would function(at least, as of now) by taking the param id/book name, passing that info
cont. to the database and searching it from there. This would be in the form of a call. Then,
cont. it would print out all the data here.
Issues:
 ~ First off, the one that comes to mind immediately, is the data passed. What I mean is not 
 cont. the normal data itself; name, description, chapters, what have you. More specifically, 
 cont. we would need pages/chapters that would link off of this page, and that could exceed a thousand.
 cont. This means we would have a dynamic route inside of a dynamic route. Not sure how that will work.
