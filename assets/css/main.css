This will be the... main css file? Ultimately, I'm not sure exactly how tailwind works, so
cont. we'll see how this pans out haha.
So, from what I can see, you would need to directly import the styles in script or style, using one of two methods:
 import '~/assets/css/something.css' in <script>
 OR @import url("~/assets/css/something.css") in <style>
I'll likely use style, just makes more sense.

And if i had read even five more inches, I would have seen we have already done that. Butttttt...
I would honestly prefer seperate stylesheets, with different directories. My pages become very long and VERY
cont. Messy. So, it would probably be fine to leave as is right now, this will be the file for the homepage.
cont. Then, we will have to import the other styles from under different file names.
